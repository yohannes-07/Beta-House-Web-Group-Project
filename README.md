# ðŸ¤–ICE SERVERðŸ¤–

ICE SERVER lets you to upload files, summarize lengthy files (videos, audio recordings, documents, images), and search through file systems or databases based on file content.
- Support for over 12 audio file types.
- Support for over 11 video file types.
- Support for over 17 document file types.
- Support for over 9 image file types.

  
## How it works

- Upload your chosen file for processing.
- Summarize the file (audio, video, document, image) you have uploaded:
  - The system interacts with external APIs for tasks such as vision processing, audio transcription, and summarization.
  - For example, for video files, it utilizes frame analysis and transcribed text to generate summaries.
- The teachable agent processes the summarized contents and stores them for later retrieval.
- Later, you can query the system through a chatbot interface, and it can provide results that match your search criteria.

 # Usage 
 
## To ensure other systems can access ICE

Step 1. Update config.json so these entries point to the actual IP.

```javascript
      "base_endpoint": "172.16.1.188",
      "base_port": "7000",
      "summarize_endpoint": "http://172.16.1.188:11434/api/generate",
```

Step 2. Update constants.js in your ICE FrontEnd application so the IP is the actual IP.

```javascript
      export const IP = "172.16.1.188";
      export const PORT = "7000";
```
